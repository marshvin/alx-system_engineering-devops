#Issue Summary:

##Duration of Outage: 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM EST on February 5, 2023

Impact: The website, which provides online shopping services, was down for 90 minutes, resulting in 100% of users unable to access the website and complete their transactions.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a software bug in the shopping cart module, which caused a database connection timeout and brought the entire website down.
##Timeline:
10:00 AM - The issue was detected by the monitoring system, which sent out an alert.
10:15 AM - The on-call engineer received the alert and investigated the issue, assuming it was a database connection problem.
10:30 AM - The engineer tried restarting the database server and checking the logs, but these actions did not resolve the issue.
10:45 AM - The engineer escalated the issue to the development team, who assumed it was a software bug in the shopping cart module.
11:00 AM - The development team found the root cause of the issue, a software bug in the shopping cart module, which was causing the database connection timeout.
11:15 AM - The development team deployed a patch to fix the bug and tested the website.
11:30 AM - The website was back up and running, and the issue was resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a software bug in the shopping cart module, which caused a database connection timeout and brought the entire website down. The bug was fixed by deploying a patch that corrected the incorrect code in the shopping cart module. The patch was thoroughly tested before being deployed, to ensure that the website would not go down again.
Corrective and Preventive Measures:
To prevent similar issues from happening in the future, the following corrective and preventive measures will be taken:
Conduct thorough testing of all code changes before deploying them to production.
Implement monitoring on the server memory and database connections to quickly detect and resolve any issues.
Regularly review and update the software and systems to ensure that they are up-to-date and secure.
Provide training for the on-call engineer and the development team to improve their incident response processes.
##Tasks:
Patch the shopping cart module
Implement monitoring on server memory
Conduct regular code reviews and update systems
Provide incident response training to the on-call engineer and development team
